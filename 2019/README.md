# 2019

## Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation

Getting started, some simple counting.

## Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm

First Intcode Computer

## Day 3: Crossed Wires

Spent some (too much) time learning about the java hash function for objects.

## Day 4: Secure Container

6-digit password, pretty easy.

## Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids

More elaborate Intcode Computer, with more opcodes and parameter modes.

## Day 6: Universal Orbit Map

Tree/graph traversal stuff, not too bad.

## Day 7: Amplification Circuit

Adding interrupts to the Intcode Computer to allow for stepping through synchronous "parallel" processing

Repeated pattern, part 2 should prob be optimized using vector x scalar multiplication.

## Day 17: Set and Forget

Intcode Computer program for watching cameras and vacuum robot.

## Day 18: Many-Worlds Interpretation

Maze with keys and doors

## Day 19: Tractor Beam

Intcode Computer program for deploying droid to coordinates and learning about a tractor beam's reach.

## Day 20: Donut Maze

Walking a maze in 2D with jumps between some steps
